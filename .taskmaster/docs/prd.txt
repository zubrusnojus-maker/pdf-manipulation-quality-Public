# PDF Processing & Manipulation Quality Project

## Overview
A Python-based PDF processing toolkit with ML-powered OCR, text manipulation, and data redaction capabilities.

## Goals
1. Process PDFs with high-quality OCR using TrOCR-Large model
2. Manipulate extracted text using LLMs (summarization, rewriting)
3. Redact sensitive data (PII) while preserving document formatting
4. Maintain 95%+ test coverage

## Current State
- ✅ PDF Processor: Core OCR and text manipulation pipeline
- ✅ PDF Redactor: PII detection and anonymization (7 pattern types)
- ✅ Quick Process: Simplified one-liner PDF processing
- ✅ Test Suite: 14 tests passing (pytest)

## Remaining Work

### Phase 1: Test Coverage
- [ ] Increase pdf_redactor.py coverage from 39% to 70%+
- [ ] Add integration tests for pdf_processor.py with mocked models
- [ ] Add tests for quick_pdf_process.py
- [ ] Add edge case tests (empty PDFs, corrupt files, unicode)

### Phase 2: Performance
- [ ] Implement batch processing for multiple PDFs
- [ ] Add progress callbacks for long-running operations
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for large documents

### Phase 3: Features
- [ ] Add support for PDF/A output format
- [ ] Implement page-level redaction reports
- [ ] Add configurable redaction patterns via config file
- [ ] Support for redacting images (faces, signatures)

### Phase 4: Documentation
- [ ] Update README with usage examples
- [ ] Add API documentation (docstrings)
- [ ] Create example notebooks

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.12
- PyMuPDF (fitz) for PDF manipulation
- Transformers + PyTorch for ML models
- pytest for testing
